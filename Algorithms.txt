Task 2
a. An algorithm that requests a user to input their name and then
stores their name in a variable called first_name . Subsequently, the
algorithm should print out first_name along with the phrase “Hello,
World”.

Solution:
Prompt user to enter first name 
Store input in a variable called first_name
Print out first_name concatenated to  Hello, World


b.An algorithm that asks a user to enter their age and then stores
their age in a variable called age . Subsequently, the algorithm
should print out “You’re old enough” if the user’s age is over or
equal to 18, or print out “Almost there” if the age is equal to or over
16, but less than 18. Finally, the algorithm should print out “You’re
just too young” if the user is younger than (and not equal to) 16.

Solution:
Prompt user to enter age 
Store input in a variable called age 
If variable age is bigger than or equal to 18
 	Print you’re old enough

Else if age is equal to or over 16, but less than 18


	Print almost there 

Else 
Print you’re just too young
