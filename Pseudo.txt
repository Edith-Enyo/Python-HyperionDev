Task 1: Thinking Like a Programmer— Pseudo Code I

a. An algorithm that asks user to enter a positive number repeatedly until user 
enters a zero value. Then determine and output the largest of the inputted numbers:

Solution:
Create list of integers
Prompt user to enter positive numbers and store each
numbers in the list
highest number  is equal to zero;

While
number entered is not equal to zero
enter another positive integer
End while loop 

then 
Compare positive integer to highest number in the list
 If larger,
 Replace highest number with positive integer.

Repeat process till you reach the end of the list

 finally 
Print highest number


b. An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then returns their arithmetic average.

Solution:
Prompt user to enter numbers randomly
let n be the max number of user inputs
 
least number of inputs equals zero
count of numbers equals zero
sum of numbers equals zero

While
least number of inputs is less than n
enter a number
count increases by one
sum increases by the value on the number entered
least number of inputs increases by one

End while 
Average equals sum divided by count
Print average

c. An algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products (in alphabetical order) that are still left to buy

Solution:

(Get further clarification on identifying what has been bought)
However,
Create a list called groceryList 

Prompt user to enter grocery items

Store items in list

Sort list in alphabetical order

Print list


d. 
-read numbers X and Y from inputs medium
-calculate the sum of both numbers by adding both numbers and assigning the value to the variable S
-calculate the average of both numbers by dividing the sum by the count of the numbers and assign the value to the variable A
-calculate the product by multiplying both numbers and assign the value to the variable P
-display the sum, average and product as calculated
