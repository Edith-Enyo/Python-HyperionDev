Optional Bonus Task

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers beginning with 0 and 1, in
which every number after the first two can be found by adding the two
numbers before it. For example, the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence
are as follows:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, …
● Create a new text file called optional_task.txt inside this folder.
● Inside the optional_task.txt file write the pseudocode for the algorithm
that asks the user for a number and stores that number in a variable
called n . Then the algorithm should calculate and print out the first n
numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

Solution:

Prompt user to enter a positive number
Assign number to varible "n"
Declare three integer variables: a, firstValue and secondValue
Since the sequence starts with 0 and 1, make firstValue = 0 and secondValue=1

Using while loop,
	ensure loop starts from 0 and is less than the given number.
